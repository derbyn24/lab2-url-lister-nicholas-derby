### Solution
I chose to use java to complete this assignment. I copied the existing `WordCount1.java` file as `UrlCount.java`. I then made the following changes:

- I adjusted the `Mapper` to read line-by-line rather than token-by-token. I then used regex to extract hrefs from each line.
- I adjusted the `Reducer` to only include urls that have more than 5 occurrences.

### Issues with the `Combiner`
Because this application uses a `Combiner` to improve efficiency, there can be some discrepancies between the expected output and the actual output. For example, the counts that were generated by my `UrlCount` application differ from the expected ones. Because the `Reducer` filters any URLs with 5 or less occurrences, any URLs that did not have more than 5 occurrences identified by a particular node are filtered out completely, even if their overall rate of occurrence is greater than 5.

### Execution Times
When executing on a `dataproc` cluster, I achieved a run time of 59.51 sec on 2 worker nodes and a run time of 1 min 15.51 sec on 4 worker nodes. At first, I thought this was rather counter-intuitive, as I figured having more nodes would result in a faster run time due to the larger amount of allocated resources. However, having more nodes requires additional effort to delegate tasks to each node, possibly resulting in the longer run time.
